Git is a de facto standard
Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. This makes Git attractive for the following reasons. At 
Atlassian, nearly all of our project source code is managed in Git.

Vast numbers of developers already have Git experience and a significant 
proportion of college graduates may have experience with only Git. 
While some organizations may need to climb the learning curve when 
migrating to Git from another version control system, many of their 
existing and future developers do not need to be trained on Git.

In addition to the benefits of a large talent pool, the predominance of Git 
also means that many third party software tools and services are already 
integrated with Git including IDEs, and our own tools like DVCS desktop 
client Sourcetree, issue and project tracking software, Jira, and code hosting service, Bitbucket.
